Some improvements to achieve on this project:

* Support more file systems (S3, etc..)
* Write tests
* Complete the README with the installation steps
* Send final report by emails
* Being able to download backups from the tools through a command
* Create differential backups (instead of full backups)
* Being able to export files
* Run the shell commands through an independent service
* Support more compressors
* Cleaning the temporary folder once finished
* Detect when the temporary folder does not have enough free space to welcome the backup
* Exporting MySQL: hiding the message 'Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.'
* Write meta-data about the backups (in order to retrieve them easily later)
